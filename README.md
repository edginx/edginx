- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @edginx with a strong background in software development, I have a deep understanding of both the technical and security aspects of software systems. I have an extensive knowledge of web application vulnerabilities, exploit techniques, and mitigation strategies.
- ðŸ‘€ My interest lies not only in crafting robust and efficient software solutions but also in uncovering vulnerabilities that may lurk beneath the surface. Web penetration testing has become my playground, where I employ my skills to identify weaknesses, expose flaws, and provide recommendations to strengthen security.
